# Does Quotex Require Verification?

Yes, Quotex requires verification for all users who wish to withdraw
funds from their trading accounts. While users can engage in risk-free
trading using a demo account without undergoing verification initially,
accessing the full range of services---especially withdrawals---demands
that users complete the verification process. This is a common practice
among reputable financial platforms, emphasizing the importance of
regulatory compliance and user safety.
